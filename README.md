# Hi, Iâ€™m Nicole Anthony  

ðŸ§ª Iâ€™m a secondary science educator with interests in biotechnology and molecular ecology.  

ðŸ§¬ My independent research explores environmental DNA (eDNA) and molecular ecology. My first project, [repliSTREAM](https://github.com/nanthony80/repliSTREAM), replicates *Ballini et al. (2024)* and compares multiple bioinformatics pipelines (Barque, APSCALE, eDNA-Container App) for fish community analysis.  

ðŸ“š Recipient of the Prime Ministerâ€™s Award for Teaching Excellence in STEM (2018), I aim to connect cutting-edge biotechnology and molecular ecology with secondary science education.  

ðŸŒ± Current interests: eDNA metabarcoding Â· molecular ecology Â· biodiversity monitoring Â· biotechnology
